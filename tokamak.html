                <p>The proposal to use controlled thermonuclear fusion for industrial purposes and a specific scheme using thermal isolation of high-temperature plasma by an electric field were first formulated by Soviet physicist O.A. Lavrentyev(left) in a paper in mid-1950. This work served as a catalyst for Soviet research on the problem of controlled thermonuclear fusion. A. D. Sakharov(center) and I. E. Tamm(right) in 1951 proposed a modification of the scheme, proposing a theoretical basis for a thermonuclear reactor, where the plasma would be torus-shaped and held together by a magnetic field.</p>
                <p>The term <b><i>tokamak</i></b> was coined in 1957 by Igor Nikolayevich Golovin, a disciple of Academician Kurchatov. Initially it sounded like "tokamag" - short for "toroidal magnetic chamber", but N.A. Yavlinsky, the author of the first toroidal system, suggested replacing "-mag" with "-mac" for euphony. Later this name was borrowed by many languages.</p>
                <h3>The first tokamak was built in 1954, and for a long time tokamaks existed only in the USSR.</h3>
                <p>Only after 1968, when the tokamak T-3 reached electron plasma temperature of 1 keV (which corresponds to 11.6 million Â° C), and British scientists with their equipment came to the USSR, made measurements on the T-3 and to confirm this fact, the world has been tokamaks boom.</p>

                <h3>On May 18 2021 the Kurchatov Institute hosted the successful physical launch of the <b>T-15MD</b> tokamak, which is the first new fusion facility in Russia in 20 years.</h3> <p>It will be used for both experiments within the ITER fusion reactor project and experiments in which the tokamak will act as a prototype of a thermonuclear neutron source will also be carried out.</p>
                <p>T-15MD is an experimental hybrid thermonuclear reactor-tokamak that was created at the Kurchatov Institute based on the superconducting tokamak T-15.</p>
                <p>The magnetic system of the T-15MD is made of silver-containing copper conductor with water cooling. Tokamak itself is close to spheromak (its aspect ratio is 2.2), will work in pulsed mode and can hold for ten seconds the plasma with a maximum current of two mega amperes. The toroidal magnetic field on the plasma cord axis will be two tesla. For additional heating of the plasma will be responsible injectors of fast atoms, gyrotrons, systems of bottom-hybrid and ion-cyclotron heating, with a total capacity of about 20 megawatts. The vacuum chamber of the unit is made of stainless steel, and graphite is selected as the material for the lining of the inner walls and the diverter.</p>
                <p>From the old T-15 unit only the infrastructure remains, which is being modernized, and all the main elements of the T-15MD are made anew. The facility itself plays one of the main roles in the national thermonuclear program, and the results obtained from it will be used to develop the future superconducting Reactor Technology Tokamak (TRT), which is to become a full-scale prototype of a thermonuclear reactor and neutron source for a hybrid reactor.</p>
